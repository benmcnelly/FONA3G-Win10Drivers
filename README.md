# FONA3G-Win10Drivers
Windows 10 Drivers for Adafruit FONA 3G Cellular + GPS Breakout for SIMCOM SIM5320 Modem

The goal here was to get the drivers for the adafruit FONA's SIM5320 working in windows 8/10, because the latest drivers from SIMCOM only work in windows 7. Here we have replaced the UID's neccissary to tell windows this will work on windows 8/10, but to get them to install you must enable non signed drivers.

Here is a simple guide on [enabling unsigned drivers in windows 10]
